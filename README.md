## WARNING!

### Spoilers abound!

These are my scripts for Advent of Code 2022. Each folder has a script. Passing in 'test' like so:

    ./01/script.rb test

runs the tests for that script. Then to test against the data (the data is stored in `data.txt` in each folder as well):

    ./01/script.rb 01/data.txt
