## WARNING!

### Spoilers abound!

These are my scripts for Advent of Code 2022. Each folder has a script. Passing in 'test' like so:

    ./01/script.rb test

runs the tests for that script. Then to test against the data (the data is stored in `data.txt` in each folder as well):

    ./01/script.rb 01/data.txt

Each day has two challenges, each rewarding a star. I'm not bothering with keeping around the script for the first star of each challenge since they're related, but I'm trying to remember to commit between challenges. So earlier versions of each script will have solutions for the first challenge of each day.
